## Heroes of Deep Learning Takeaways

| Hero | Top Takeaway |
| --- | --- |
| `Geoff Hinton` |  |
| `Ian Goodfellow` | Don't worry about degree. Produce quality work on a website that will attract offers.  |
| `Ruslan Salakhutdinov` | Before compute explosion, Deep RBMs were viewed as frontier of AI.  |
| `Andrej Karpathy` | Suprised how good ImageNet was a general feature extractor that could be fine tuned for other applications.   |
