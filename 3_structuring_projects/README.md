# Course 3: Structuring ML Projects
#### :star: Best ML engineers know which specific know to tune to achieve specific effect Y :star:
:star: **Things you don't learn in any other course ! Takes years of real world experience** :star:

## Orthogonalization
- Process of tuning 1 knob to tune 1 aspect of performance. 
- Not orthogonal = 1 knob to tune multiple parameters. Eg: One button on TV that controls image width, height, slanting
based on this eqn:
